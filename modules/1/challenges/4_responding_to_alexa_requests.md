# 4: Responding to Alexa Requests

In this challenge, we will get our Sinatra application responding to Amazon's requests in a way the Alexa Service expects.

To complete this challenge, **construct a JSON response from your application whenever the Alexa Service makes a request to your endpoint.**

> These challenges continue to assume that you are using Sinatra and ngrok. If you are using a different set of tools, please adapt as appropriate.

### New Concepts

- Alexa-style JSON requests and responses

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [ ] Using the [Alexa Response Body Documentation](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/alexa-skills-kit-interface-reference#response-body-syntax), create the minimum possible response required to make Alexa say 'Hello World' whenever the endpoint is hit.
- [ ] Restart the server, and test out the new response in the Service Simulator.

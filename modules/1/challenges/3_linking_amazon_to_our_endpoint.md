# 3: Linking Amazon to our application's endpoint

In this challenge, we will get Amazon talking to our Sinatra application.

To complete this challenge, **configure your Amazon Skill to use the HTTPS Endpoint and verify that Amazon can talk to your application using the Service Simulator.**

> These challenges continue to assume that you are using Sinatra and ngrok. If you are using a different set of tools, please adapt as appropriate.

### New Concepts

- Connecting Alexa to a local development environment

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [ ] Through the Alexa Developer console, set your Alexa Skill Endpoint to the HTTPS address you got from ngrok in the previous challenge.
- [ ] On the next page, use ngrok's wildcard SSL certificate for your ngrok subdomain.
- [ ] Use the Service Simulator to send a test request to your application.
- [ ] Verify that your application has received a JSON packet identical to the one displayed on the Service Simulator.
